       <h1> American Society for Velociraptor Attack Prevention</h1>
<p>attack is the 3rd leading cause of death for men age 27-29.</p> 
However, everyone must think about the implications of velociraptors:
young and old, men, women and transgendered persons.
<p>The American Society for Velociraptor Attack Prevention is a bi-partisan</p>
group of professionals, dedicated to the diffusion of knowledge concerning
velociraptor attack prevention.
<h2>the Enemy</h2>
<p>The velociraptor is a bipedal carnivore with a long, stiffened tail and</p>
can be distinguished from other dromaeosaurids by its long and low skull,
with an upturned snout. It has a relatively large, sickle-shaped claw,
typical of dromaeosaurid and troodontid dinosaurs. This enlarged claw, up
to 67 millimeters (2.6 in) long around its outer edge, is a predatory
device, used to tear into the prey, delivering a fatal blow.
<p>Velociraptors are commonly found on tropical islands, converted to</p>
millionaire amusement parks, but are commonly being sighted in the Pacific
Northwest.
<h3>Essential facts you should know about velociraptors:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Velociraptors hunt in packs, and are known to form an equilateral triangle
around its prey.</li>
<li>Velociraptors can accelerate 4 m/s2, with a top speed of 25 m/s on open</li>
terrain, 10 m/s while wounded, and 10 m/s in indoor laboratories.
<li>Velociraptors can open doors, but are slowed by them. They can open an</li>
initial door in approximately 5 minutes, and will take half that time for
each subsequent door.
<li>Velociraptors do not know fear.</li>
</ul>
<h4>New Home Buyer Tips</h4>
<p>When buying a new home, there are a few things to look out for when</p>
assessing potential velociraptor attacks:
<ol>
<li>Check all doors and windows. Doors should be made of solid oak or steel.</li>
Windows should have steel bars with spacing smaller than the average
raptor.
<li>Make sure all entryways have adequate deadbolts. Quality deadbolts may be</li>
purchased at your local Home Depot.
<li>Always keep a loaded big-game rifle under your bed, and tire irons near</li>
every door. Remember, you should never be farther than 20 feet away from a
tire iron.
</ol>
